# Motion for Flutter widgets

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/motion.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/motion)


This package adds a new `Motion` widget that applies a gyroscope-based effect to Flutter widgets. On desktop or when the gyroscope in not available, the effect is based on the pointer's hovering.

Check out the **[live demo](https://cendre.me/motion_example/)** !


!["Demo of the Motion plugin"](https://github.com/mrcendre/motion/raw/main/gifs/demo.gif)

To see examples of the following effect on a device or simulator:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

# How to use 

First, add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  motion: ^<latest-version>
```

Then, wrap your target widget as child of a `Motion` widget. You may optionally provide a `MotionController` instance that will hold individual widget's transformations (useful for pointer based events). The simplest usage of this widget is the following :

```dart

import 'package:motion/motion.dart';

...

return Motion(child: myWidget);

```

# Custom behavior

## Elevation

To remain consistent with the Material design language, you can pass an **elevation** parameter to the widget by using the `Motion.elevated` constructor. 

It will influence the offset, opacity and blurriness of the shadow. Possible values for `elevation` range between `0` and `100`.

!["Elevations examples"](https://github.com/mrcendre/motion/raw/main/gifs/elevations.gif)

_Comparing different elevation values_

## Shadow

The **shadow** is optional and depends, when using the `Motion.elevated` constructor, on the `elevation` value. The higher the `elevation`, the blurrier and the lower from behind the widget the shadow will get. The amplitude of the shadow's movement also depends on the widget's elevation. This aims to achieve the same behavior as Material design language's notion of elevation.

_Comparing with and without the shadow effect_

By default, the `shadow` is enabled but you can disable it by constructing the `Motion` widget with `shadow: null` or by using the `Motion.only` constructor. 

## Glare

The **glare** effect is also optional. It is a very subtle gradient overlay that confers a reflective feel to the widget. *This effect is not rendered on Safari iOS due to limitations on gradients performances.*

!["Glare effect comparison"](https://github.com/mrcendre/motion/raw/main/gifs/glare.gif)

_Comparing with and without the glare effect_

Also enabled by default, you can disable this effect by constructing the `Motion` widget with `glare: false` or by using the `Motion.only` constructor.

## Custom effects configurations

You can provide custom configurations for the glare, shadow and translation effects by passing `GlareConfiguration`, `ShadowConfiguration` and `TranslationConfiguration` to the `Motion` and `Motion.only` constructors. When omitted, the default values will be used, unless if you use the `Motion.only` constructor which only applies the tilt effect by default.

## Update interval

By default, the sensor's update and pointer events intervals are set to **60 frames per second**.

Higher values will result in more accurate motion data and thus smoother motion of the widgets,
but will also have an increased impact on performances.

Ideally, the update interval should match [Flutter's recommended 60 FPS (frames per seconds)](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/ui-performance). However, a performance compromise may be required on certain older devices. In that case, you could use the standard 30 FPS or 24 FPS, the latter being the lowest frame rate required to make motion appear natural to the human eye.

The best practice for setting the sensor rate is to do it once, when initializing your app, like so :

```dart
void main() {

  /// Initialize the plugin.
  await Motion.initialize();

  /// Globally set the sensors sampling rate to 60 frames per second.
  Motion.setUpdateInterval(60.fps);

  /// Run the app.
  runApp(...);

}
```


## Filter quality

The Motion widget implementation wraps the child with a matrix-based `Transform` widget. On most platforms, it is a good practice to have it set to `FilterQuality.medium` or `FilterQuality.high`. You may specify it directly from the widget's constructor :

```dart
  Motion(
    filterQuality: FilterQuality.high,
    child: ...
  )
```

When omitted, the default value `FilterQuality.medium` is used.

However, please note that due to limitations on Safari iOS, it is always enforced to `null` in this specific browser.


# Permission

*This implementation is optional. You may skip but Motion will not work on any iOS 13+ Safari browser.*

Starting from iOS 13, the Safari browser requires to call `DeviceMotionEvent.requestPermission()` to listen to `devicemotion` events. This permission **must be requested upon user gesture**, otherwise the Promise will automatically be rejected.

To detect if the permission is required, you can check the `Motion.isPermissionRequired` property after calling `Motion.initialize()`.

If required, you can either call `Motion.requestPermission()` after presenting the user a rationale dialog or after pressing a button. An implementation can be found in the [example app](https://cendre.me/motion_example/).

No other platform permission to access sensor data is implemented for now.
